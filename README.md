## Where is the problem?

Most smartphones these days have long-living batteries, but who doesn't want their phone to last for just an hour more?
While using an app, you maybe not nessesarily need your display. So, why donâ€™t turn it off? Up to 20% of your battery
power is consumed by the display.

## Here is the solution!

FakeStandby is an Android app to turn off your screen while keeping apps running. This includes foreground jobs, which means
you can keep

- listening to music on YouTube
- staying online on WhatsApp and other text messengers
- running your favorite game

all with your screen turned off.

## How does it work?

The app is basically launching an overlay over the app currently running. Therefore it is using Android's accessibility services. All it's rendering
on the overlay is a black canvas, effectifly turning your pixels off. The apps you're using won't notice this, beacause technically your phone is turned on.

## Disclaimer

Some smartphones have LCD displays with background lighting, that only turns off, when you really press the power button to lock your phone.
The concept works better for OLED or AMOLED displays, where "turning pixels black" is identical to "turning pixels off"
You should not except huge power saving effects on any device especially on devices with LCD display.
